# About

This directory contains the protobuf-based interface definition (IDL) for the
BigQuery V2 service (bigquery.googleapis.com).

These artifacts are being published to enable work on new Cloud Client Libraries
rather than the current SDKs, which are based around API discovery and Google
API Client generation tooling.

We discourage their direct use externally at this time, and will
communicate changes here and via channels like the per-language release notes.
